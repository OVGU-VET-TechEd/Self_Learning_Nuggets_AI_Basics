## Real-World TVET Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Construction Training with AI

@scenarioCard(Smart Building Technology Training, **Maria**, an instructor at a construction training institute, faces the challenge of integrating AI-powered building design software into her curriculum. The new tools can optimize material usage and predict structural issues, but she must ensure students understand both the technology and the ethical implications of automated decision-making in construction safety.)

**Key Question:** How should Maria balance teaching technical AI skills while maintaining focus on safety ethics and professional responsibility?

                          --{{1}}--
In this scenario, Maria represents thousands of TVET instructors who must adapt their teaching to include AI tools while maintaining the fundamental principles of their trades. Construction safety cannot be compromised, even as AI enhances efficiency.

### Scenario 2: Healthcare Training Revolution

@scenarioCard(AI-Assisted Diagnostics in Nursing Education, **Dr. Ahmed**, a nursing instructor, is implementing AI diagnostic assistance tools in his clinical training program. While these tools can help student nurses identify patterns in patient data more quickly, he must ensure they develop critical thinking skills and understand when to question AI recommendations.)

**Key Question:** How can Dr. Ahmed ensure his students become competent healthcare professionals who use AI as a tool rather than a replacement for clinical judgment?

                          --{{2}}--
Healthcare education presents unique challenges with AI integration. The stakes are incredibly high, and the need for ethical, quality-focused training is paramount to patient safety and care excellence.
