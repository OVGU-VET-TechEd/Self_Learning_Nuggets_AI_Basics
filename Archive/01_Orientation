    [( )] AI makes all assessment decisions about student competence
    [[?]] Consider which option enhances rather than replaces learning
    <script>
      if (@input === 3) {
        send.lia("‚úÖ **Perfect!** Using AI to generate diverse practice scenarios enhances learning opportunities while maintaining human judgment and hands-on experience.");
      } else {
        send.lia("‚ùå **Reconsider.** The best AI applications augment human learning and decision-making rather than replacing critical educational components.");
      }
    </script>
