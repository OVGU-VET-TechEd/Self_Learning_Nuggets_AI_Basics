Introduction
Now that we’ve covered AI basics and stressed the importance of human agency, let’s look at practical AI tools available to teachers and how they can be applied. This module aligns with the competency of “AI foundations and applications” – essentially building your digital toolkit and understanding how to use it wisely. Rani has heard of various AI tools by name – ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gamma – but she isn’t sure what each does or how they differ. We will define these tools, discuss where they get their data, and examine issues like accessibility (do you need a login or payment?), hallucination and bias tendencies in each, and how they align with the idea of Open Educational Resources (OER). By exploring and comparing these tools, you’ll be better equipped to choose the right AI tool for the task at hand and use it effectively in your teaching practice.
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Common AI Tools
First, what do we mean by LLMs (Large Language Models)? These are AI models trained on huge amounts of text data to predict and generate text. They are the brains behind many modern AI chatbots and assistants. When you interact with ChatGPT, Claude, or even search engines with chat features, you’re talking to an LLM. They excel at understanding natural language inputs and producing human-like responses. However, as we saw, they have no real understanding of truth – they just generate likely responses based on patterns in data. This is why they can be so helpful (rich language, many facts) yet sometimes wrong or weird (they might lack up-to-date info or context).
Let’s introduce some common AI tools that teachers might use, many of which are powered by LLMs or other AI algorithms:
@aiDemo("Brainstorm 3 hands-on project ideas for an electronics class about renewable energy.", "ChatGPT", "https://chat.openai.com/")
@aiDemo("Find recent examples of AI used in electronics manufacturing (with sources).", "Perplexity", "https://www.perplexity.ai/")
@aiDemo("Proofread and improve the clarity of my lesson plan on circuit theory.", "Claude", "https://claude.ai/")
@aiDemo("Create a 5-slide presentation outline on "Introduction to Robotics" for students.", "Gamma", "https://gamma.app/")
The examples above give a hint of each tool’s strength. Now, let’s describe each tool and what it’s best for:
ChatGPT: This is a conversational AI developed by OpenAI. It’s a general-purpose chatbot that can generate text, answer questions, write code, and more. ChatGPT is known for its versatility – you can ask it to explain concepts, create quizzes, write stories, solve problems, etc. Accessibility: ChatGPT has a free version (as of now) accessible via web (you need to sign up). There is also a paid version with more features (ChatGPT Plus) but the free version is quite powerful. Data origin: It was trained on a diverse range of internet text up to a certain cutoff (for example, if it’s using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5, the knowledge might cut off around 2021-2022 unless augmented). It does not cite sources by default. Hallucination: ChatGPT can hallucinate – it might present false info confidently if asked for facts, so caution is needed. Bias: It tries to avoid offensive or biased outputs due to OpenAI’s alignment efforts, but it can still reflect biases present in its training data. Best uses: Brainstorming, drafting written material, answering conceptual questions, coding help. Rani uses ChatGPT to get ideas for lab activities and to simplify complex electronics theory into analogies her students can grasp.
Perplexity: Perplexity is like a smart search engine with an LLM. When you ask it a question, it not only gives an answer but also provides citations (links to sources) for its claims. This is hugely valuable in education because it means you (and your students) can verify information. Accessibility: It’s available via web without login for a limited number of queries, and it’s free (with some optional sign-in for more features like longer memory). Data origin: Perplexity connects to the live internet (similar to doing a web search) and finds information, then uses an LLM to summarize or directly answer you. Thus, it’s good for up-to-date questions. Hallucination: Perplexity’s use of sources greatly reduces hallucination, since it bases answers on actual retrieved documents. But if the web info is wrong, it could propagate that. Bias: Because it pulls from the web, it can reflect common biases online or in source selection (though citing helps you see if sources are balanced). Best uses: Research questions, getting summaries with sources, quick facts. Rani might use Perplexity to quickly gather the latest developments in AI for electronics to share with her class, knowing she can trust but also verify the sources it provides.
Claude: Claude is an AI assistant made by Anthropic, and it’s known for having a large context window (meaning it can digest or produce longer texts at once) and for being tuned to be helpful and harmless. It’s somewhat similar to ChatGPT in that you give it prompts and it generates responses. Accessibility: Claude has a web interface (Claude.ai) which may be available in certain regions, and it also has an API. There is a free tier (with limitations on how much you can use daily) and possibly premium tiers. Data origin: Claude was trained on a lot of text as well, and its knowledge cutoff is similar to ChatGPT’s (at training time). It doesn’t browse the web by itself in the free version. Hallucination: Claude also can hallucinate, but it sometimes is more cautious or verbose in explanations. It’s been noted to be good at tasks like summarization or rewriting because of its large context capability. Bias: Anthropic emphasizes an ethos of AI safety; Claude is designed to avoid toxic content and is generally neutral. However, like any model, if underlying data had biases, those can emerge. Best uses: Claude is great for processing longer documents – e.g., Rani can paste a whole chapter of curriculum or a long policy document and ask Claude to summarize or extract key points. It’s also good for getting alternative phrasing (like improving a draft letter or simplifying technical jargon). In one case, Rani used Claude to draft a polite email to parents explaining a new AI tool in class – Claude’s suggestion was clear and parent-friendly, which saved her time editing.
Gamma: Gamma is a tool specifically designed to create presentations or structured documents from outlines or prompts. Think of it as an AI that generates slides (with text content and simple visuals) for you. Accessibility: Gamma.app offers a free usage for creating a certain number of decks. You provide a prompt or content and it designs a slideshow. It’s web-based. Data origin: Gamma uses generative AI to produce both the text on slides and design elements. It likely uses a combination of an LLM for text and some design template logic for layout. It may also integrate image generation for illustrations (depending on the version). Hallucination: If Gamma needs to produce factual content, it might still get things wrong (since it uses an LLM for text). So if you ask for a presentation on a topic, double-check the facts on each slide. However, if you provide the content details and just let it handle design, then hallucination isn’t an issue – you are providing the info. Bias: Since it generates content, it could reflect biases or omissions. For example, if asked to create a presentation on “famous inventors,” it might present mostly Western male inventors unless prompted otherwise. Being aware of that, you might need to adjust the prompt or the output for diversity. Best uses: Quickly turning a text or idea into a visual presentation. For a busy teacher, Gamma can produce a decent first draft of slides for a lesson or a student project showcase. For instance, Rani had her students use Gamma to create quick project proposal slides – the AI gave them a starting layout and text, which they then customized. It saved them from staring at a blank PowerPoint screen. Gamma is particularly handy when you want an appealing format without spending much time on design.
To compare these tools in a nutshell:
ChatGPT vs Perplexity: ChatGPT is like an all-knowing but source-less mentor; Perplexity is more like a librarian that always shows the book pages where it found the answer. If Rani wants creative ideas or draft content, she’ll choose ChatGPT. If she wants research with references (e.g., “what are the latest statistics on skilled trades employment?”), Perplexity is her go-to for trustworthy answers.
ChatGPT vs Claude: Both can do similar tasks. Claude might handle longer text better in one go, and some users find its tone more friendly or its reasoning a bit more straightforward. ChatGPT sometimes is more clever in coding or niche knowledge due to extensive fine-tuning. Rani might try both on a task like “summarize this technical article for my students” and see which summary she prefers – often, having multiple AI assistants can be like getting second opinions.
Gamma vs ChatGPT: ChatGPT can output an outline for slides or even ASCII “slides”, but it won’t give a polished look. Gamma’s advantage is automatically turning an outline into an actual slide deck format with design applied. ChatGPT would require Rani to copy-paste content into PowerPoint or such, whereas Gamma could spit out a ready-to-present deck in its interface. However, Gamma’s generated text might not be as detailed as ChatGPT’s, since it balances brevity for slides. So, Rani could actually use them in tandem: first ask ChatGPT for an outline, then feed that to Gamma to make slides, then edit the slides as needed.
Data origin & accessibility considerations: It’s important to note which tools have internet access or up-to-date knowledge. Perplexity does; ChatGPT free version does not (unless you have a plugin or the newer Bing-integrated mode). Claude currently does not browse internet either. Gamma doesn’t research facts; it relies on what you prompt. So if currency of information matters (e.g., in September 2025 discussing a 2025 event), Perplexity would shine. If it’s general knowledge or creative content, ChatGPT/Claude are fine. Accessibility-wise, some schools might have restrictions: e.g., ChatGPT might be blocked on school networks due to age restrictions or privacy concerns. In those cases, teachers would need to use it at home or get special permission. Always check your institutional guidelines and ensure any tool used complies with student data privacy laws (for instance, don’t input sensitive student info into these public AIs).
Data, Hallucination, and Bias in These Tools
We’ve talked conceptually about hallucination and bias; let’s relate specifically:
Data Origin: Knowing where a tool gets its information is key to trust. ChatGPT and Claude have a knowledge base from training data (which could be outdated). They do not dynamically cite recent info (unless using some attached browsing). So they might confidently get facts wrong if asked about something post-training or obscure. Perplexity pulls from current web content, so its answers on current events or specific data are more reliable, and you see the source. Gamma doesn’t fetch facts; it uses its trained knowledge to fill in content (and presumably might not be tuned for factual accuracy as much as for formatting). Thus, if Gamma writes a slide “AI in 2025 is present in X% of factories” – you’d want to verify that number; it might just guess.
Hallucination Tendencies: ChatGPT has become somewhat better at avoiding obvious nonsense, but if you ask it for a list of references, it might hallucinate article titles that sound real but aren’t. Perplexity virtually never fabricates references because it shows actual links. Claude also might make up stuff if pushed beyond its knowledge. Gamma could put together plausible but not verified statements. For instance, one teacher reported an AI slide tool produced a reference to a study that didn’t exist – likely a hallucinated detail to make the slide look credible. So again, double-check facts from AI-generated content before sharing with students.
Bias Examples: Each tool might reflect biases differently. ChatGPT and Claude have filters to avoid hateful/offensive content, which is good, but they might exhibit subtle biases (like gender or cultural biases in examples they generate, unless prompted to diversify). Perplexity’s bias largely depends on sources: if most top web results have a certain slant, the summary might lean that way (though seeing multiple sources can alert you to a bias). Gamma might include images or iconography that default to a certain cultural context (e.g., an AI-generated image of a “student” might not represent the diversity of your classroom). As an educator, you should use inclusive prompting (“include examples from different parts of the world” or “use gender-neutral language” etc.) and review outputs for bias or stereotypes.
AI and OER (Open Educational Resources)
The idea of openness is important in education. Open Educational Resources (OER) are materials that are free to use, adapt, and share. With AI, there’s an intersection: AI can help create OER, but also raises questions about content ownership. For instance, if Rani uses ChatGPT to generate an explanation and she shares that handout with colleagues, is that OER? Typically yes, if she licenses her handout openly. But note that AI-generated text can be used freely as ChatGPT outputs are not copyrighted by OpenAI (as per their terms, the user owns the output rights). Still, good practice is to cite that it was AI-assisted to maintain transparency.
UNESCO has been advocating for open solutions in AI in education – meaning the algorithms, data, and resources should, as much as possible, be openly accessible to ensure equity. The Doha Declaration on Education and Skills (2024) echoed the need for collaboration and open sharing of knowledge to harness AI for all
unesco.org
. Additionally, the upcoming Dubai Declaration on OER and AI emphasizes using open licenses and sharing materials created or assisted by AI. In practical terms, this means Rani is encouraged to share any lesson plans or materials she creates with AI under an open license (like CC BY), so other teachers can reuse and adapt them, multiplying the benefits. AI can rapidly generate content, so if one teacher openly shares those outputs, many others can benefit without each having to prompt from scratch. This aligns with OER’s spirit of collaboration and reducing duplication.
However, Rani also stays aware of the Doha Declaration’s call for sustainable, inclusive AI: that includes using tools that are accessible. For example, if a tool is behind a paywall or needs high-end hardware, it might not be equally accessible to all schools. Open-source AI tools or free tools help bridge that gap. A mention here is the rise of open-source LLMs – there are community-driven models that any school could run without depending on a big company. While ChatGPT and Claude are proprietary, projects like HuggingFace Transformers or Open Assistant exist. They might not yet be as polished, but in the long term, open AI ecosystems could offer more control (schools could host their own AI that is safe for student use, for instance).
Summary of OER concept: AI tools should ideally help produce materials that anyone can use. UNESCO’s OER recommendations encourage teachers to license their AI-generated educational content openly. Rani decides that any slide decks or worksheets she makes with help from AI, she will share on a national teacher platform with an open license. AI saved her time creating them, so sharing is a fair way to pay it forward. Plus, if the AI content had any errors she missed, other teachers might catch and fix them – a community quality improvement, very much in the spirit of OER.

(This table isn’t exhaustive, but covers the major players Rani has explored. The landscape of AI tools changes quickly, so always be on the lookout for new ones, and apply the same critical lens to them.)
Rani’s Use Case: Lesson Generation with AI Tools
To illustrate how these tools can come together in a real workflow, let’s follow Rani as she prepares a lesson on “Safety in Electronics Workshops” using AI assistance:
Brainstorming Content (ChatGPT): Rani starts by asking ChatGPT, “What topics should I cover in a lesson about safety in electronics workshops for vocational students?” ChatGPT suggests a list: electrical safety basics, proper use of tools, personal protective equipment, first aid for electrical accidents, etc. It even provides a few illustrative examples (like the importance of grounding). This gives Rani a solid outline to begin with.
Researching Statistics (Perplexity): She wants to include a statistic about how common electrical injuries are in workplaces. She asks Perplexity, “How many workplace electrical injuries occur annually and what is a common cause?” Perplexity returns an answer citing a source (perhaps an OSHA report or ILO data) – e.g., “According to OSHA, there were X electrical injury incidents in 2022 in the US, with improper lockout/tagout being a leading cause.” Rani clicks the provided reference to double-check context, then notes it down to mention in class.
Drafting a Handout (Claude): Next, Rani has a bunch of notes and wants to compile them into a one-page handout for students. She feeds Claude a prompt: “Here are points for a safety handout. [she lists bullet points]. Please turn this into a concise, well-structured handout, with clear headings and maybe a short quiz at the end.” Claude processes her detailed input and produces a nicely formatted draft. It includes headings like “Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)” and a short 3-question quiz. Rani reviews it – she likes the structure but edits a couple of sentences to better fit her class’s context (Claude had used a very formal tone in places; she makes it a bit more conversational). She also swaps out one of the quiz questions for a more relevant one.
Creating Slides (Gamma): With content ready, Rani tries Gamma to generate a slide deck. She provides a prompt, “Create a presentation about Safety in Electronics Workshops covering: common hazards, safety precautions (PPE, tool handling), emergency procedures, and a summary.” Gamma produces a 5-slide draft, each with a simple layout. It includes some icons (like a helmet icon for PPE) and titles for each section. The text is okay but slightly generic. Rani uses the Gamma editor to tweak text on slides, adding the specific stat she got from Perplexity onto the hazards slide, and inserting an image of a properly organized electronics workstation (she uploads one or uses an image search if Gamma supports it). In 15 minutes, she has a polished slide deck – far quicker than starting from scratch.
Quality Check (Human in the Loop): Before finalizing, Rani cross-verifies everything: facts against sources (done), clarity of language (she imagines explaining to ensure no confusing AI wording remains), inclusivity (she ensured examples mention both “he” and “she” or neutral references – one AI draft slide said “Every electrician should know his tools” which she changed to “their tools”). She also checks for any inadvertent bias – for example, the AI’s suggested emergency procedure primarily focused on what the supervisor does; she added what students should do as well to make it relevant to her class, removing a bias towards managerial perspective.
The result: Rani has an engaging lesson ready – slides, handout, quiz – with significantly less effort on her part. She used multiple AI tools, each for what they do best, and applied her professional judgment throughout. This integration demonstrates AI pedagogy in action – AI for planning and material creation, while Rani remains the orchestrator ensuring quality and appropriateness.
@sectorCard("Electronics Class Prep with AI","Task: Prepare a lesson on soldering techniques. <br><br>Rani’s AI-augmented Workflow:<br>1. 🤔 Ideation: She asks ChatGPT for a list of “common mistakes in soldering and how to avoid them” – using this to frame her lesson’s key points.<br>2. 🔍 Fact-check: One tip from ChatGPT is “Avoid cold solder joints by ensuring sufficient heat.” Rani queries Perplexity for “What causes cold solder joints?” and confirms the explanation from a cited electronics forum. It matches up.<br>3. ✍️ Materials: She drafts a step-by-step lab activity description (with some gaps) and feeds it to Claude, asking for a student-friendly instruction sheet. Claude returns a well-structured set of instructions including safety reminders.<br>4. 📊 Slides: Using Gamma, she generates slides summarizing do’s and don’ts of soldering, including an AI-suggested image of a perfect solder joint vs a bad one. She double-checks that the AI image labels are correct (they are, in this case).<br>5. 📝 Review: Rani carefully reviews all outputs, ensuring consistency (she notices “tinning the tip” was mentioned by Claude but not on the slides, so she adds it). She also localizes the language (changing “soldering iron wattage” to “temperature” since her students use temperature-controlled irons).<br><br>Outcome: The lesson prep that used to take her 3-4 hours took about 1.5 hours with AI assistance. The content is richer (the AI surfaced a mistake she hadn’t initially listed) and she feels confident because she verified every part. Her students appreciate the clear handouts and visuals – all thanks to combining her expertise with the AI toolbox.")
As shown, leveraging each tool’s strength while applying teacher oversight leads to efficient and high-quality outcomes. This is the essence of using basic AI techniques and applications in education: know your tools, use them thoughtfully, and keep the educator’s insight at the core.
